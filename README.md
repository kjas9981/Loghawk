# üõ°Ô∏è LogHawk

LogHawk is a lightweight and open-source log monitoring tool designed to help security teams and analysts automatically analyze log files for suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts, traffic spikes, critical system errors, and unauthorized script activities.

## üöÄ Why Use LogHawk?

Security teams face a major challenge: log files are massive, complex, and often poorly organized. These logs can contain critical early warning signs of malicious activity‚Äîsuch as unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalations, or unusual network behavior‚Äîbut manually reviewing them is time-consuming and error-prone.

LogHawk is a script-based tool designed to automate the log analysis process. It parses and filters relevant entries from various system and service logs, scanning them for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as:

- Repeated failed login attempts (brute-force attack indicators)
- Suspicious user privilege changes
- Connections to known malicious IP addresses
- Unusual traffic volumes or protocol usage
- Presence of suspicious scripts or binaries

By automatically highlighting these anomalies, LogHawk empowers security teams to:

- **Accelerate incident detection and triage**
- **Reduce human error in log review**
- **Strengthen security posture through early response**
- **Generate actionable insights without deep manual digging**

## üåü Key Benefits of Using LogHawk

- **Efficiency**: Cuts through noise by extracting only what matters.  
- **Simplicity**: Easy to deploy and run with minimal dependencies.  
- **Transparency**: Clearly documented rules and filters for how IoCs are flagged.  
- **Extensibility**: Can be adapted to support additional log formats or rules.
